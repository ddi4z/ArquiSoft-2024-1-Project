## Project Objective

Achieve the digitization of the credit card (TDC) application process, so that customers can acquire this financial product with Banco de Los Alpes.

## Project Context
This project was carried out in the ISIS2503 Software Architecture course. During the course, various architectures were developed using context, domain, deployment, and component diagrams for a real bank. Additionally, several user stories and ASR (System Quality Attributes) were created.

## Technologies Used
The implementation of the architectures was done in Python, using the Django and Flask frameworks. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was also used for the deployment of the application.

## Project Structure
- diagrams: Contains the diagrams developed throughout the course.
- sprint_3: Includes the code developed during the first three sprints.
- sprint_4: Contains the final project delivery, using a microservices architecture.

## Code Repository
The original development of the application was done in the organization's Azure repository, so the complete history of all commits is not shown in this repository, and the execution of the .yaml files may not be entirely correct.

## Working Methodology
The implementation was carried out in four sprints:

- Sprint 1: Definition of initial diagrams, ASR, and user stories.
- Sprint 2: Work focused on latency and scalability.
- Sprint 3: Focus on security and availability.
- Sprint 4: Implementation of microservices.

## Acknowledgments
This project was considered the best in the section, which allowed us to present the architectures to the client and obtain their approval.
