## Project Objective

Achieve the digitization of the credit card (TDC) application process, so that customers can acquire this financial product with Banco de Los Alpes.

## Project Context

This project was carried out in the Software Architecture and Design course (ISIS2503) of the University of the Andes. During the course, various architectures were developed using context, domain, deployment, and component diagrams for a real bank. Additionally, several user stories and ASRs (Architecturally Significant Requirements) were created.

## Technologies Used

The implementation of the architectures was done in Python, using the Django and Flask frameworks. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was also used for the deployment of the application. The load balancer and API gateway were implemented with Kong. Finally, various libraries were used for certain specific functionalities, which can be seen in the requirements.txt

## Project Structure

- diagrams: Contains the diagrams developed throughout the course, along with a presentation of the evolution of the architecture.
- sprint_3: Includes the code developed during the first three sprints.
- sprint_4: Contains the final project delivery, using a microservices architecture.

## Working Methodology

The implementation was carried out in four sprints:

**Sprint 1:** Definition of initial diagrams, ASR, and user stories.

**Sprint 2:** Work focused on latency and scalability.

**Sprint 3:** Work focused on security and availability.

**Sprint 4:** Implementation of microservices.

## Acknowledgments

This project was considered the best in the section, which allowed us to present the architectures to the client and obtain their approval.
